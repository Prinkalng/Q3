 <h3>Euclid’s Postulates</h3>
<strong><p>1. It is possible to draw a straight line from any point
to another point.</p>
<p>2. It is possible to extend a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.</p>
<p>3. It is possible to create a circle with any centre and
radius.</p>
<p>4. All right angles are equal to one another.</p>
<p>5. If a straight line crossing two straight lines makes
the interior angles on the same side less than two
right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are
less than the two right angles.</p>
 <h3>Euclid 'The Elements'</h3>
The Elements is a collection of definitions, postulates,
propositions (theorems and constructions), and mathematical proofs of the propositions. The books cover
plane and solid Euclidean geometry, elementary number
theory, and incommensurable lines.</strong>
