    <h3>Euclid’s ‘Elements’ contains 465 propositions,93 problems and 372 theorems in thirteen volumes. Let us mention some widely used  results.</h3>
<strong><p>1. Euclid gave the proof of a fundamental theorem of arithmetic, i.e., ‘every positive integer greater than 1 can be written as a prime number or is itself a prime number’.</p> <p>For example, 35= 5×7, etc.</p>
<p>2. He was the first one to state that ‘There are infinitely many prime numbers, which is also known as Euclid’s theorem. He further elaborated this statement by saying that ‘for any given (finite) set of primes, if you multiply all of them together and then add one, then a new prime has been added to the set (suppose P=36 and 36=2×3×6, where p1=2, p2=3, p3=5(6-1), which shows that there is a prime no. 5
which was not there in the list of factors initially. It is a process, which can be repeated infinitely.</p>
<p>3. First four perfect numbers were identified by Euclid only. Perfect numbers are the numbers that are sum of all of their divisors, excluding the number itself. For example,6= 1+ 2+3</p>
<p>28 = 1+2+4+7+18</p>
<p>496 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248</p>
<p>8128 = 1+2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 127 + 254 + 508 + 1016 + 2032 + 4064</p>
<p>He also observed some very interesting properties of perfect numbers.</p>
<p>a) They are triangular numbers, so they are the sum of all consecutive numbers up to their largest prime factor.</p>
<p>For example, 6=1+2+3, 28=1+2+3+4+5+6+7, 496=1+2+3+…..+30+31, 8128=1+2+3+…..+126+127</p>
<p>b) Their largest prime factor is a power of 2 less one, and the number is a multiple of this number is a multiple of this number and
power of 2 of the previous factor.</p>
<p>For example, 6 = 21(22-1); 28 = 22(23-1,496 = 24(25-1);8,128 = 26(27-1)</p>
<p>4. He gave the proof of the Pythagoras theorem. Although there were hundreds of proof already in existence his proof was exact and lucid. He used only those propositions and definitions that he had already proved to be true. He used geometry instead of algebra to derive this post.</p>
<p>5. Maybe the Golden ratio (also called the golden mean or golden section) was first known to Pythagoras, its perfect explanation was given by Euclid. Two quantities a and b are said to be in the Golden ratio if(a+b)/a=a/b=ϕ, where the Golden ratio is denoted by the Greek letter ϕ. It comes out to be an irrational number whose value is 1.618…..Its application in real life is that it is used to determine the proportions of natural and man-made objects. The golden ratio also exists in nature in the form of a spiral arrangement of leaves and other parts of plants.</p>
<p>6. He also formulated Euclidean Algorithm, which states that The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers A and B is the largest integer that divides both A and B.</p>
<p>For example, Let A= 36 and B=48, then GCD (36, 48) is calculated as:</p>
<p>If A≠0, B≠0, then by Long division method we can write 48=1×36+12, then we will calculate GCD (36,12) as GCD (36,48)=GCD (36,12)
Here A=36 and B=12, then by long division method, we can write 36=12×3+0. So, GCD (36,48)=3. We will stop this process when either A or B will become 0.</p></strong>
