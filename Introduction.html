   <h1>INTRODUCTION TO EUCLID</h1>
 </center>
  <strong>Euclid or Euclid of Alexandria was a great Greek mathematician. He is also known as the Father of Geometry. There is no authentic information about his death
  birth dates, but it is assumed that he was born and
  brought up in the era of Ptolemy. He gave many theorems in  mathematics, more precisely in geometry. He
  is mainly known for his work in the field of geometry.
  He used to study the work of the mathematicians who
  preceded him. His main motive was to synthesis their
  work, i.e., rearranging their work to find something new.
  <p>In his findings, he mostly used a deductive approach. He
  used the facts that were known to him and derived various theorems out  of them, and he compiled his findings
  in his most famous book titled ‘The Elements.’ Many
  of the facts mentioned in this book were already known,
  but initially, they were just statements. Euclid imparted
  proofs to those axioms. His book ‘The Elements’ serves
  as a textbook in many schools to date.</p></strong>
