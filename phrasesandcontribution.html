    <h3>Phrases by Euclid</h3>
<strong>”What is asserted without proof, can be denied without proof.”
<p>”There is no real way to Geometry.”</p>

<h3>Some other contribution of Euclid</h3>
 <h4><li>Data</li></h4>
It is comprised of 96 geometric propositions and all of them follow the same format.
 <h4><li>On Division (of Figures)</li></h4>
It was extracted in 1915 from Arabic and Latin versions. It comprises problems of dividing figures into various ratios by drawing a number of straight lines.
 <h4><li>Euclidean Catoptrics</li></h4>
This book deals with the phenomena of reflected light and image forming optical systems using mirrors. This arrangement is also known as catopter.

 <h4><li>Phaenomena</li></h4>
This book deals with mathematical astronomy. It means how stars and the moon move. He used a mathematical approach to study when stars rise above the horizon and when they set below it.
 <h4><li>Optics</li></h4>
In the view of Euclid, the approximate height of an object is measured in terms of the angle formed by the straight lines passing from the top and bottom of the object reaching the observer’s eye. He also proposed that nearer objects appear to be bigger and seem to move faster. Adding further he discovered how to measure the height of distant objects from their shadow.</strong>
