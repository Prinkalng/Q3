   <strong><p>1. Things which are equal to the same thing are equal
   to one another.</p>
   <p>2. If equals are added to equals then wholes are equal.</p>
   <p>3. If equals are subtracted from equals then the reminders are equal.</p>
   <p>4. Things which coincide with one another are equal to<
   one another.</p>
   <p>5. The whole is greater than a part.</p>
   <h2>Meaning of Axioms</h2>
   Mathematics is often known to be the study of logic. Every problem defined here is supposed to have a solution.
   Mathematical problems are mostly solved with the help
   of theorems, formulae, and axioms. Although theorems
   and formulae require proper mathematical proof, there
   are some statements in mathematics that are accepted
   and self-evidently true; these are known as axioms. Euclid gave 10 axioms and subdivided them into 5 axioms
   and 5 postulates. The difference between axiom and postulate is that postulates are meant for a specific field like
   geometry, whereas axioms are applicable in every field of
 science.</strong>
